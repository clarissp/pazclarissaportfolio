# Welcome!
<center> This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data. </center>

# About Me 
<p> My name is Clarissa Paz and I am a second-year MSPPM student. I received my B.A. in policy studies from Syracuse University and decided to pursue my Master's degree directly after completing my undergraduate studies. After being introduced to geographic information systems (GIS) at Heinz, I absolutely fell in love with GIS. So much so that I am now actively pursuing a job that would allow me to use my GIS skillset. </p>
<br> 
<p> When I am not in the computer lab using GIS, I am usually performing duties for my extracurricular involvements on campus. I am currently serving as the Director for a campus wide organization called Students Using Data for Social-Good (SUDS). SUDS attempts to facilitate opportunities that allow students to apply their skillset to doing good. This is primarily done with data projects with real clients, workshops, speakers, etc. I am also one of the coordinators of the Diversity in Policy Mentor Program (DPMP) at Heinz College. DPMP is a student run initiative that partners with the admissions office to try to increase the diversity of students that are admitted to the policy programs at the Heinz College. Last but not least I am one of the Highland Ambassadors from the Alumni Association. Highland Ambassadors is an initiative that attempts to create more meaningful interactions between current students and CMU alumni. </p>

# What I Hope to Learn
Since GIS is one of the many ways to visualize data, I am really hoping to learn the best practices of how to visualize geospatial data so that I can make maps that easily convey data findings. I also hope to learn what charts, graphs, or tables are the most appropriate for visualizing the various data types.
