# Clarissa Paz's Portfolio 
This is my portfolio for Telling Stories with Data! 

# About Me 
My name is Clarissa Paz and I am a second-year MSPPM student. I am a born and raised New Yorker that is a huge animal lover. Fun fact, I am slightly obsessed with pig and this upcoming Chinese New Year is the year of the pig! 

# What I hope to learn 
Post graduation my dream job would allow me to use GIS in my day to day work. Since GIS is one of the many ways to visualize data, I am really hoping to learn the best practices of how to visualize data so that I can make maps that easily convey data findings.
