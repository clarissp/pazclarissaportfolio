# Elevating Pennsylvania's Solar Future Part I 

For the final project I choose to focus on the potential for deploying solar in Pennsylvania. I hope to convince my audience that despite the gloomy weather in Pittsburgh, solar is feasible for Pennsylanvia and is worth the investment! By the end of the story, I hope to empower my audience to reach out to Pennsylvania representatives to pass legislation that would ease the deployment of solar. I plan on convincing the audience with various data visualizations that will be showcased through Shorthand. A brief outline on how I plan to tell my story is available [here.](http://preview.shorthand.com/wWfeZSjmxCHmzSZq)

# Part 2 

As shown above, the initial stage of my project included creating a brief outline on how I plan to convince my audience to reach out to their representatives to encourage politicans to pass legislation that would increase the deployment of solar. In order to bring this story to life, I created sketches of the data visualizations I would incorporate in my story. My thought process for the three sketches are as follows: 

###### Sketch #1 
For my first sketch, I wanted to include a visual on what Pennsyvlania's current energy portfolio looks like. My purpose in including this visual is to show my audience just how small of a slice that renewable energy makes up. Subsequently, I immediately thought to make a pie chart to convey this. In addition to the pie chart, I wanted to include a callout on the renewable energy sector. This callout would be a bar graph that would emphasize how minimal solar electricity generation is in Pennsylvania. This is the initial sketch that I came up with: ![sketch1](/Sketch1.png)

###### Sketch #2 
For my second sketch, I wanted to incorporate a visual on what Pennsylvania's future would look like if it were to deploy grid-scale solar. In order to acheive this I wanted to showcase some of the data analysis that I performed last semester as part of my capstone project. For my capstone project we were able to identify approximately 30 sites that are ideal for solar deployment. Subsequently, I wanted to include a visual on just how many sites are feasbile for solar and where they are located. It is for this reason that I used my GIS skills to create a map that showcased this: ![sketch2](/Sketch2.png)

###### Sketch #3 
The last visual that I wanted to include in my summary is the positive impact that these identified sites could have on Pennsylvania. As part of my capstone team's analysis, we performed a financial and enviornmental assessment on these sites. The financial assessment was done to see if the sites were financially attractive for solar devlopers. The environmental assessment calculated how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would be avoided if these sites were installed. For the purpose of this story, I wanted to focus on the environmental assessment because I believe that message would be easily conveyed to the audience. I thought the best way to convey this would be a circle packing graph: ![sketch3](/Sketch3.png)

###### User Research 
<p> After I finished the sketching of my visuals, it was important to take the time to see if the visuals were conveying the message that I wanted it to. In order to do this properly, I had to think of who my target audience is. I decided that the target audience that I would most benefit from seeing/hearing my story is civically mindeded individuals that believe in doing good for society. Upon determining my target auidence, I then identified a few people that would belong in that target audience. By attending a policy school, it was not at all difficult to find some. Ultimately, I asked three people for feedback on my storyboard and skethes: Mayo, Michael, and Temeca. I did not pick these three people by random, I had a strategy when it came to asking them for feedback. My reason for choosing Michael was because he is also taking the same Telling Stories with Data class and is learning the same principles as I am. Because he is learning the same principles I am, his feedback acted as a confirmation that I was incorporating all that we have learned so far. My reason for picking Mayo was because she was one of the students that took Telling Stories with Data from a different professor. Her professor was an employee at Deloitte that specialized in data visualization. By asking for her feedback, I wanted to see if I was incorporating other data visualization principles that might not be covered in this class. Lastly, I chose to ask Temeca for feedback because she is very committed to giving bakc to her community but does not have any background in renewable energy. By asking for her feedback, I wanted to ensure that someone who knew nothing about solar could understand the message I am trying to tell. </p> 

**Interview Script**
<br> 
Now that I identified the people who I would be asking feed back from, I had to determine what questions I was going to ask them. In order to make it the most casual and informal conversation, I only came up with two structured questions. Based on their responses, I wanted the freedom to be able to ask them questions specific to their answers. The two questions that I asked all three inviduals were: 
1. What message do you get from this graphic? 
2. What was the first thing that grabbed your attention and why? 

**Feedback** 
<br>
<p>Insteading of quoting word for word, what the feedback was I wanted to give a general overview on common themes throughout all three responses. For the first sketch, the general consensus was that the visual was too busy. It was noted by all three individuals that there were a lot of numbers in the graphic and it was unclear what message they were supposed to get. Specifically, Temeca thought the focus would be on the larger slices of the pie chart as opposed to the small slice of renewable energy. For the second sketch, the general consensus was the complete opposite of the first sketch; two of the three said that there was not information in the visual. Both noted that it was helpful to see which counties had more feasible sites of solar however, the location was the only thing they could gather from the map. One of the two mentioned that it might be useful to see just how large each site could be. Another critism was the choices I made in color, why had I chose teal for the outlines of the county. For the third sketch, the only critique was their lack of background in solar made it difficult for two of them to be able to ascertain the significance of the data. One of them argued that this was easy to decipher due to the sizes of the circles. However, those that did not feel there was enough background knowledge recommended adding some sort of visual that could serve as a reference point. Lastly, when it came to feedback on my storyboard outline, all of them enjoyed the medium that I was using to tell my story. They all thought it was organized and structed. The only critique I got on one of the sections was in regards to the solar policy portion. They voiced concern on possibly losing the audience's attention on the nuances of solar policy.  </p>

**Incorporating Feedback* 
<p> After conducting my user research, it was time to incorporate the feedback that I received. So far I was only able to incoroporate the feedback from my first sketch. I have yet to incorpoarte the feedback for sketch two and three however, I do know how I plan on incorporating them. In regards to my first sketch, I ended up completely scrapping the pie bar chart combo. Instead I ended up with creating a doughnut chart that exploded two slivers of the doughnut for both renewable energy and solar energy. That way there is no clutter of numbers and directs my audience to the two main numbers I want them to focus on. I'm still in the process of finalizing my first visual but here is a sneak peak on what it will look like. ![PAEnergy](/PA Energy Portfolio.png) For my second sketch I plan on keeping the map format with the addition of another layer. I'm planning on creating a layer of graduated points, that could showcase just how much acreage each site could occupy. That way the audience will know not only where the sites are but also how large they are in comparison to the others. For the third sketch I plan on coverting it almost to an infographic. I think I will be sticking with the circle packing graph; accompanying the graph will be a pictograph. By pictograph I mean the same visualization that I used to showcase the breakdown of immigrants. This way it can serve as a reference on just how large these potential sites are in capacity. In regards to my story board, I plan on scaling back on the solar policies portion of my story. Instead of outlining all of the solar policies in Pennslyvania, I plan on focusing only on the policies that impede the deployment of solar. This way the audience knows the exact policies that they can ask their representatives to remedy.
