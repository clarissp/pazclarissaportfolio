# Elevating Pennsylvania's Solar Future Part I 

For the final project I choose to focus on the potential for deploying solar in Pennsylvania. I hope to convince my audience that despite the gloomy weather in Pittsburgh, solar is feasible for Pennsylanvia and is worth the investment! By the end of the story, I hope to empower my audience to reach out to Pennsylvania representatives to pass legislation that would ease the deployment of solar. I plan on convincing the audience with various data visualizations that will be showcased through Shorthand. A brief outline on how I plan to tell my story is available [here.](http://preview.shorthand.com/wWfeZSjmxCHmzSZq)

# Part 2 

As shown above, the initial stage of my project included creating a brief outline on how I plan to convince my audience to reach out to their representatives to encourage politicans to pass legislation that would increase the deployment of solar. In order to bring this story to life, I created sketches of the data visualizations I would incorporate in my story. I specifically included three visuals that I believe would help support the message of my story. The initial sketches of these are as follows: ![Sketch1](/Sketch1.jpeg)
