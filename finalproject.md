# Elevating Pennsylvania's Solar Future Part I 

For the final project I choose to focus on the potential for deploying solar in Pennsylvania. I hope to convince my audience that despite the gloomy weather in Pittsburgh, solar is feasible for Pennsylanvia and is worth the investment! By the end of the story, I hope to empower my audience to reach out to Pennsylvania representatives to pass legislation that would ease the deployment of solar. I plan on convincing the audience with various data visualizations that will be showcased through Shorthand. A brief outline on how I plan to tell my story is available [here.](http://preview.shorthand.com/wWfeZSjmxCHmzSZq)

# Part 2 

As shown above, the initial stage of my project included creating a brief outline on how I plan to convince my audience to reach out to their representatives to encourage politicans to pass legislation that would increase the deployment of solar. In order to bring this story to life, I created sketches of the data visualizations I would incorporate in my story. My thought process for the three sketches are as follows: 

###### Sketch #1 
For my first sketch, I wanted to include a visual on what Pennsyvlania's current energy portfolio looks like. My purpose in including this visual is to show my audience just how small of a slice that renewable energy makes up. Subsequently, I immediately thought to make a pie chart to convey this. In addition to the pie chart, I wanted to include a callout on the renewable energy sector. This callout would be a bar graph that would emphasize how minimal solar electricity generation is in Pennsylvania. This is the initial sketch that I came up with: ![sketch1](/Sketch1.png) . 

###### Sketch #2 
For my second sketch, I wanted to incorporate a visual on what Pennsylvania's future would look like if it were to deploy grid-scale solar. In order to acheive this I wanted to showcase some of the data analysis that I performed last semester as part of my capstone project. For my capstone project we were able to identify approximately 30 sites that are ideal for solar deployment. Subsequently, I wanted to include a visual on just how many sites are feasbile for solar and where they are located. It is for this reason that I used my GIS skills to create a map that showcased this: ![sketch2](/Sketch2.png). 

###### Sketch #3 
The last visual that I wanted to include in my summary is the positive impact that these identified sites could have on Pennsylvania. As part of my capstone team's analysis, we performed a financial and enviornmental assessment on these sites. The financial assessment was done to see if the sites were financially attractive for solar devlopers. The environmental assessment calculated how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would be avoided if these sites were installed. For the purpose of this story, I wanted to focus on the environmental assessment because I believe that message would be easily conveyed to the audience. I thought the best way to convey this would be a circle packing graph: ![sketch3](/Sketch3.png).
